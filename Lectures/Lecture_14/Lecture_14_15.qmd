## Review

- Why do we care about public opinion?

        - Our democracy is a consensual democracy, not a majoritiarian democracy
        - Everyone is entitled to representation, not just the winners of elections
        - Public opinion is a barometer of the health of our democracy
        
- Is the US a democracy? Yes

        - It is a representative democracy, not a direct democracy
        - It is a consensual democracy, not a majoritarian democracy
        - The rights of political minorities matter
        
- Is the US a republic? Yes

        - Simple: not a monarchy
        - More complex: res publica, the public thing
        - The people own the government not vice versa
        - This also means that all the people own the government, not that the majority own the minority
        
        
## Barack Obama at UN General Assembly

"As we do every time this year, Presidents and Prime Ministers converge on this great city to advance important work. But as leaders, we are not the most important people here today. It is the civil society leaders who, in many ways, are going to have the more lasting impact, because as the saying goes, **the most important title is not president or prime minister; the most important title is citizen."**



## Review: Why does this matter for today's topic?

- Elections matter
- The type of elections matter, too

        - not just majoritarian
        - the way we handle elections takes rights of political minorities into account
        - If the stakes of elections are too high, consent of the minority is threatened

## Presidential General Election

Electoral College

        - Indirect election
        - Candidate names are on the ballot
        - We elected Electors pledged to those candidates
        - Electors meet in December to cast their votes
        - Congress counts the Electoral College votes in January
        

- Indirect election of the chief executive is not unique to the United States
        
        - The Electoral College is unique to the United States
        - Most democracies are parliamentary systems where the chief executive is chosen by the legislature
        - The Electoral College is a compromise between direct election and election by the legislature
        - Preserves federalism and the power of the states
        - Preserves the Separation of Powers (Congress role is extremely limited)

## Election campaigns

- Campaigns are long and expensive
- Campaigns are run by professional staff
- Campaigns are media-driven
- Expensive campaigns favor incumbents over challengers

        - incumbents: current officeholders
        - challengers: candidates running against incumbents
        
- Incumbents have name recognition and a record to run on
- Incumbents have access to campaign funds from PACs and other sources

## Exam 2 Results: Distribution of Percentage


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(here)
exam2 <- read.csv(here("data","exam2.csv"))

# convert score to percentages and save to percent_score

exam2$percent_score <- exam2$score/135 * 100




# create letter_grade where percent_score >= 93 is an A, 90-93 is an A-, 87-89 is a B+, 83-86 is a B, 80-82 is a B-, 77-79 is a C+, 73-76 is a C, 70-72 is a C-, 67-69 is a D+, 63-66 is a D, 60-62 is a D-, and < 60 is an F

exam2$letter_grade <- cut(exam2$percent_score, breaks = c(0, 60, 63, 67, 70, 73, 77, 80, 83, 87, 90, 93, 100), labels = c("F", "D-", "D", "D+", "C-", "C", "C+", "B-", "B", "B+", "A-", "A"))
```



```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# plot distribution of percent_score

hist(exam2$percent_score, main = "Distribution of Exam 2 Percent Scores", xlab = "Percent Score", col = "lightblue", border = "black")
```

## Exam 2 Results: Distribution of Grades


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# plot distribution of grades

barplot(table(exam2$letter_grade), main = "Distribution of Exam 2 Grades", xlab = "Grade", ylab = "Number of Students", col = "lightblue", border = "black")



```

## Exam Results Overall

```{r}
# load grade categories data

grade_categories <- read.csv(here("data","grade_categories.csv"))

head(grade_categories)

# plot Participation.Total (X) against Exams.Total (Y) with ab line using lm()

plot(grade_categories$Participation.Total, grade_categories$Exams.Total, main = "Participation Total vs Exams Total", xlab = "Participation Total", ylab = "Exams Total", col = "blue")
abline(lm(grade_categories$Exams.Total ~ grade_categories$Participation.Total), col = "red")


```


## Exam Results Overall

```{r}
# plot Inquizitives.Total (X) against Exams.Total (Y) with ab line using lm()

plot(grade_categories$Inquizitives.Total, grade_categories$Exams.Total, main = "Inquizitives Total vs Exams Total", xlab = "Inquizitives Total", ylab = "Exams Total", col = "blue")
abline(lm(grade_categories$Exams.Total ~ grade_categories$Inquizitives.Total), col = "red")



```

## Exam Reulults Overall


```{r}
# create and plot a linear model with Exams.Total as the dependent variable and Participation.Total and Inquizitives.Total as the independent variables




model <- lm(Exams.Total ~ Participation.Total + Inquizitives.Total, data = grade_categories)



# plot using sJPlot marginal effects

model_plot1 <- sjPlot::plot_model(model, type = "pred", terms = c("Participation.Total", "Inquizitives.Total"), title = "Exam Total Predicted by Participation and Inquizitives", axis.title = "Predictor", axis.title.x = "Exam Total", axis.title.y = "Predictor Value")

# Create two columns in the slide, place the stargazer table in the first column and the sjPlot plot object (model_plot1) in the second column


library(stargazer)
stargazer(model, type = "text")


```

## Exam Results Overall

```{r}

```





## Exam 2 Extra Credit

- Open Point Solutions
- If you have any problems, see me after class before leaving

# Texas Culture and Politics

## Participation points

- Open Point Solutions
- If you have any problems, see me after class before leaving
- Once we all leave the room, results stand


## Political Culture of Texas

- Diverse political culture has two themes that are shared across party, ethnic, and religious lines

        - Individualism
        - Traditionalism
        
## Individualism

- Grew from multiple sources

        - Frontier experience of self-reliance
        - Settlers looking for Economic opportunity (this continues today)
        - American Revolutionary ideals
        
## Traditionalism

- Grew from multiple sources

        - Frontier experience of neighbors cooperating especially through churches
        - Provincialism 
        - Business dominance

        
        
        
## The cultures and partisan politics
        
- Before the 1990s, the Democratic Party appealed successfully to these cultures
- Since 1990, the Republicans social conservative wing has connected with Texan's traditionalism
- The Republicans business oriented wing has connected with Texan's individualism 
- The national Democratic Party difficulty connecting: notable exceptions such as the Clintons and Obama

        - Great Plains
        - Gulf Coastal Plains & Basin regiona - outside urban areas
        
        
        
## Things to consider in Texas political culture

 - If we were going to have writing assignments, these are some questions I might ask. Why?
 


## Things to consider in Texas political culture

 - If we were going to have writing assignments, these are some questions I might ask. Why?
 
- If you consider these questions using the textbook, you will better grasp the concepts and be better prepared for the exam.

## Things to consider in Texas political culture

Moral to the story: Consider questions like these as you are reading and doing the Inquizitives. 

Reviewing the Chapter outlines **first** may give you other questions to focus on when working on the chapter.



## Things to consider in Texas political culture
        
- Individualism: Consider the following?

        - the specifics vary but this is a fundamental characteristic of Texas culture
        - What about variation among demographic groups? Is there any or is this a commonality?       
        - Native Texans and newly arrived Texans?




## Things to consider in Texas political culture

- Traditionalism and Individualism can be in conflict

        - How does this play out in Texas politics?
        - How does this play out in Texas policy?
        - How does this play out in Texas political parties?
        
- Do Traditionalism and Individualism always conflict or can they reinforce each other?

        - When does traditionalism encourage self-reliance?
        - When traditionalism encourages community cooperation, does that encourage or discourage individualism compared to reliance on state or federal government?

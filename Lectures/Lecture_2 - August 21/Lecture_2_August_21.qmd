1 - No one is in any kind of trouble for GroupMes that were setup
2 - Related to the above, question for the class:

Would you like to have one official GroupMe for the class where I will post reminders and announcements? We can also use Microsoft Teams for this purpose, but there seems to be a strong preference for GroupMe.

You can use it for study groups, getting notes if you miss class, etc.

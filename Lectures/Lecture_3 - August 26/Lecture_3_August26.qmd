::: {style="font-size: 2em;"}
Given that government's unique tool is the organized use of coercive physical force or violence, what are legitimate uses of that tool?
:::

## Organized Violence and the Proper Role of Government

- One relatively common concept is that government gets its powers on loan from the people for the common defense. It's just a pooling of individual rights and powers for the common good.

So....


## Organized Violence and the Proper Role of Government

::: {style="font-size: 3em;"}
What are legitimate uses of violence for individuals or small groups?
:::

## Organized Violence and the Proper Role of Government

- Pooled defense - no extra powers
- Monopoly on violence: State has extra responsibilities and therefor has extra powers derived from its responsibilities.

## Organized Violence and the Proper Role of Government

- Pooled defense - no extra powers
- Monopoly on violence/State Responsibility
- Various forms of extreme state power

## Defining limits on government force

- Pacifism
- Non-aggression principle   

## Defining limits on government force

Minimalist Violence (Charles Krauthammer): The idea that "it is the mark of a civilized society to maintain organized violence at the lowest possible level," using force only when absolutely necessary to maintain order, protect the rights of citizens, and perform agreed upon functions.

        - may be associated with social contract theory, constitutional limits on violence, and humanitarian intervention
        - The key is that whatever the goal, it should be achieved at the lowest level of coercion possible.

- Constitutional Limits on Violence


## Defining limits on government force

Constitutional Limits on Violence: "Constitutional Restraint" or "Limited Sovereign Coercion"

        - The notion that the use of force by the government should be strictly limited by a constitution, whether formal or informal, which outlines when and how the government may act.
        
## Defining limits on government force

Constitutional Limits on Violence: "Constitutional Restraint" or "Limited Sovereign Coercion"

        - The notion that the use of force by the government should be strictly limited by a constitution, whether formal or informal, which outlines when and how the government may act.
        - James Buchanan, Nobel prize winning economist and constitutional theorist, argued that setting the Constitutional limits should be done with near unanimity, while "ordinary politics" can be done with majority rule or other agreed standards. (We will return to this idea when considering why we don't just disregard the Constitution when it is inconvenient.)
        - This is closely related to social contract theory, but constitutional constraints are more specific and formal than the general principles of social contract theory.

- Pacifism
- Non-aggression principle        
- Minimalist Violence 
- Constitutional Limits on Violence
- Social contract theory

## Defining limits on government force

Social contract theory: Individuals consent to give up some freedom (submit to some coercion) in exchange for protection of their rights. 

        - Thomas Hobbes, argued that the social contract is necessary to prevent the "war of all against all" and that the government should have nearly unlimited power to prevent this.
        - John Locke, argued that there are still basic rights not subject to coercion and people have the right to revolt against a government that violates these rights.
        - Jean-Jacques Rousseau, argued that the social contract should be based on the "general will" of the people, which is not the same as the majority will.
        - The social contract is a fictional construct, not an actual document or group of documents like a Constitution.

## Defining limits on government force

Humanitarian intervention: 

        - preventing or stopping human rights abuses
        - large scale action in natural disasters
        - coercive action to correct or prevent economic crises
        - scale redistribution of wealth or other resources to prevent suffering or promote equality.
        - may include military intervention in other countries.

- Militant democracy

## Defining limits on government force

Militant democracy: suppression of political opponents perceived or labeled as threats to democracy

        - The idea that it is legitimate for a government to use force to prevent the rise of anti-democratic forces or to suppress political movements that threaten the democratic system.
        - Often used to justify the suppression of political parties or movements that are seen as a threat to democracy.
        - May actually be suppression of threats to the established party system.

- Militant democracy
- Realpolitik/Pragmatic statecraft


## Defining limits on government force

Realpolitik/Pragmatic statecraft: Pragmatic results matter more than idealism

        - The government should use force to pursue its national interests, regardless of moral considerations.
        - Often used to justify military intervention in the affairs of other states, or the use of force to protect the economic interests of the state.
        - May be used to justify the use of force to suppress dissent or to maintain the power of the ruling party.
        - Order is more important than justice or rights.

## Defining limits on government force

Theocracy: government derives its powers from a diving mandate

        - Use of force is morally justified for any reason chosen by the divinely mandated rulers. 
        - Often used to justify the use of force to suppress dissent or to enforce religious laws.
        - Still not completely unlimited, as ideals of the religion may still limit the actions of the rulers.

## Defining limits on government force

Totalitarianism: unlimited power over all aspects of life.

        - The idea that the government should have unlimited power to control all aspects of society, including the use of force to suppress dissent and maintain control.
        - Often used to justify the use of force to maintain the power of the ruling party or to enforce ideological conformity.
        - Government rule extends into all aspects of life, including the private sphere even the home and family.

- I will refer to all of these collectively as *participation exercises*.

- For participation exercises, you must be physically present in the classroom! 
- No sharing of access codes!

## Course Policies: Attendance and Participation

- I will cross reference the location based attendance with participation exercises to prevent academic dishonesty.
- If an access code is shared, at least one of the parties will be referred to a hearing with a recommendation that they fail the course and be suspended.
- If the person caught using the code comes clean, it will be the person sharing the code.

## Course Policies: Attendance and Participation

- Must be present in class for participation exercises
- Location based attendance with Clicker/PointSolutions
- Some extra credit for good attendance 


## Course Policies: Academic Integrity

- Academic integrity is non-negotiable
- Specific issues:

        - Sharing access codes with people outside the classroom

        - Not doing your own homework
        - Lying to me or any member of the faculty or administration about your work
        - Trying to cheat in CASA 
        
You are responsible for following the full UH Academic Integrity Policy
        
## Exams - CASA

- Two Midterm Exams (60 points each) and one Final Exam (75 points): 50%

## Major course expectations - revisit

I sincerely hope that all of you will succeed in this course, but UH and I are not in the business of selling grades and degrees. You will get out of this course what you put into it, both in learning and your final grade.

## Purpose and Dangers of Federal Government

    - Different branches of government
    
    

## What about other issues?

- The focus on splitting up power missed some other issues
- Some of this was compromise

    - 14 of the states were independent nations before becoming states
    - Federal government needs enough power but not too much (Constitutional Convention)
    - Preventing bad long-term decisions (Amendment process, Bill of Rights)





# Missing the Ideal 

## Why do we care?

- What are the lessons for our own time?
- What issues do we need to continue fixing?
- Or do we throw it all out?


## Fredrick Douglass "Fourth of July" Speech

- He asks, "What to the slave is the Fourth of July?"

## Fredrick Douglass "Fourth of July" Speech

- He asks, "What to the slave is the Fourth of July?"
- He also speaks with respect about the Founders ideals and with hope about achieving the ideals of the Declaration of Independence

## Fredrick Douglass "Fourth of July" Speech

- He asks, "What to the slave is the Fourth of July?"
- He also speaks with respect about the Founders ideals and with hope about achieving the ideals of the Declaration of Independence
- The speech was a condemnation of the wrong of slavery as a violation of the ideals of America

## Fredrick Douglass "Fourth of July" Speech

- He asks, "What to the slave is the Fourth of July?"
- He also speaks with respect about the Founders ideals and with hope about achieving the ideals of the Declaration of Independence
- The speech was a condemnation of the wrong of slavery as a violation of the ideals of America

## Fredrick Douglass "Fourth of July" Speech

## Fredrick Douglass "Fourth of July" Speech

Fellow Citizens, I am not wanting in respect for the fathers of this republic. The signers of the Declaration of Independence were brave men. They were great men too—great enough to give fame to a great age. 


## Fredrick Douglass "Fourth of July" Speech

They were statesmen, patriots and heroes, and for the good they did, and the principles they contended for, I will unite with you to honor their memory.  


## Fredrick Douglass "Fourth of July" Speech

With them, nothing was “settled” that was not right. With them, justice, liberty and humanity were “final;” not slavery and oppression. You may well cherish the memory of such men.

## Fredrick Douglass "Fourth of July" Speech


They were great in their day and generation. Their solid manhood stands out the more as we contrast it with these degenerate times.  How circumspect, exact and proportionate were all their movements! How unlike the politicians of an hour! Their statesmanship looked beyond the passing moment, and stretched away in strength into the distant future. They seized upon eternal principles, and set a glorious example in their defence. Mark them!



## Early Problems with American Government

- Slavery
- Limited rights of women
- Limited voting

## Why were these problems?

Aside from the moral question,

::: {.custom-style style="font-size: 120px;"}
**What was the big issue that all of these shared?**
:::


## Why were these problems?

::: {.custom-style style="font-size: 120px;"}
**They conflict with classical liberal ideals!**
:::

## Why were these problems?


::: {.custom-style style="font-size: 120px;"}
**America was imperfect by its own standards**
:::

## America started out imperfect

- **America was imperfect by its own standards**
- **Some of this was compromise**



## Slavery and Classical Liberal ideals

- Slavery conflicts with the ideal of individual liberty



## Slavery and Classical Liberal ideals

- Slavery conflicts with the ideal of individual liberty
- Slavery **conflicts with the basis of property rights**

        - The basis of property rights is that individuals own themselves and their labor
        - The product of their labor is their property
        - Taking the product of someone else's labor other than by voluntary exchange is violating their right to property


## Limited rights of women

- Women's rights to own property were severely restricted
- This **necessarily** restricted their liberty
- There were explicit restrictions on women's liberty

## Limited voting

- Voting was

    - Restricted to land owners
    - Restricted by race
    - Restricted by gender




# Evolution of American Government

## Moving forward

- **Even A lot of the Founders recognized the problems**
- **Evolution and future solutions were expected - Amendments**

## How have some of these problems evolved?

- Slavery 1865^[But this didn't resolve issues of race]
- Property rights for women - 1900^[State by state]
- Voting rights - 1865, 1920, 1969^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_voting_rights_in_the_United_States]



# Thinking about solutions

## Solutions? What is still wrong? What is right?


- Work to fix remaining (classical) liberal inconsistencies and contradictions? Rethink exact limits and role of government in a basically liberal framework?
       
        - Traditional Republicans and Democrats
        - Libertarians
        - Forward Party 


## Solutions? What is still wrong? What is right?

- Retain the liberal structure
- Some other standard - some form of authoritarianism?

        - Populist Economic Nationalism (Trumpism)
        - Populist Socialism (Sanders, The Squad)
        
- How much of the current structure should remain? How much is safe to tinker with? Increase or decrease liberalism (limits on power)?


## Solutions? What is still wrong? What is right?

- New problem: Massive new restrictions on individual empowerment at the federal level

        - Surveillance state
        - Censorship of speech and assembly
        - Economic restrictions
        - Political restrictions
        - Social restrictions 
        - Cultural restrictions
        - Educational restrictions
        - Health restrictions

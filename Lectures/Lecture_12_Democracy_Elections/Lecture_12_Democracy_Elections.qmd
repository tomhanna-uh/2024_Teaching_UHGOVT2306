# Democracy and Elections


## Is the United States a democracy?

- What is a democracy?
- The right wing critique: Democracy is bad (or not important) and the United States is a Republic not a Democracy (based on James Madison's and Aristotle's definitions of democracy)
- The left wing critique: Democracy is good and the United States fails to meet democratic standards (Assorted)

                
## What is a Democracy?

- Accurate understanding requires definition

- Word roots:

                + demos: the people
                + cracy: a form of government

Democracy - rule by the people

## Republic

- Republic 

        - not a monarchy
        - res publica - political power resides in the public
        - a form of government in which the country is considered a "public matter" - not the private concern or property of the rulers

## Right Wing Critique

- Modern: "The United States is a Republic not a Democracy."
- This is mostly a result of 18th century (1780s) terminology and earlier
- This also considers **Aristotle's** view that democracy was corrupt
- It's also a result of people taking very seriously the writings of one person: **James Madison**
- These folks argue that the US is not a democracy and they argue that is a good thing

## Aristotle Types of Government

![Types of Government](govt_types.jpg)


## James Madison

+ Framer of the *Constitution*
+ Coauthor of the *Federalist Papers*
+ concerned with preventing "mob rule" type democracy
+ Very much a student of Aristotle
+ Referred to the United States system as **representative government** and called it a **Republic**
+ Aristotle would have called this a **Polity**



## James Madison on Democracy

+ "The essence of Government is **power**; and power, lodged as it must in human hands, will ever be liable to abuse." -- 1787

+ "Place three individuals in a situation wherein the interest of each depends on the voice of the others, and give to two of them an interest opposed to the rights of the third. Will the latter be secure? The prudence of every man would shun the danger. The rules & forms of justice suppose & guard against it. Will two thousand in a like situation be less likely to encroach on the rights of one thousand?" -- 1821


## Questions about modern democracy

Is modern democracy Madison's mob rule or Madison's Republic?

Is modern democracy a good protector of rights?




## Madison's Republic

-   Representative government not direct
-   Limited franchise
-   Protection of political minorities 
-   Opposition to one party rule - protection against party domination
-   Fragmentation of parties to divide their power
-   Protection of basic civil liberties (Madison - Bill of Rights)
-   Protection of property rights


## Modern Western or liberal democracy

-   Representative government not direct
-   Universal franchise (or near)
-   Protection of political minorities
-   Opposition to one party rule - protection against party domination
-   Fragmenation of parties to divide their power
       
              + US and British style  systems - no  
              + Proportional representation systems - yes


-   Protection of basic civil liberties
-   Protection of property rights


## Republic vs Liberal Democracy and the United States

- Modern liberal democracies have all major features of Madison's Republic except limited franchise
- Some modern liberal democracies have Madison's fragmentation of parties to divide power
- The United States lacks two features of Madison's Republic:

        - limited franchise (more democratic)
        - effective fragmentation of parties to divide power 

        

## The Left Wing Critique

- Democracy is good
- The United States is not a democracy because:

                + Electoral College
                + Supreme Court
                + Economic inequality
                
                

## Electoral College

- Chief executive must be elected **directly or indirectly**
- Electoral college is unique, but indirect election is not
- Prime ministers are elected by parliament in 32 of the 50 members of the European Union
- Prime ministers are elected by parliament in 50 out of 89 electoral and liberal democracies in the world
- Prime ministers are elected by parliament in 42 out of 67 liberal democracies

## Electoral College

- **The chief executive is indirectly elected in the majority of democracies**

- The Electoral College is unique but indirect election of the chief executive is the standard in democracies




## Supreme Court - Major Issues

- The Supreme Court may block laws passed by the elected branches
- The Supreme Court blocks majority rule




## Supreme Court - Responses

Blocking majority rule to protect minority rights is crucial to a functioning democracy and this is the Supreme Court's role

- The rule of law is major characteristic of liberal democracy
- Rights of political minority's must be protected to ensure they can contest the next election
- Consensual democracy is partially defined by the idea that citizens have rights that a simple majority can not take away
- We may not like the outcome in a specific case, but the process of protecting rights guarantees our own rights



## Economic inequality

- This is a complaint about outcomes, not really anything to do with the political system
- This is actually a complaint about the *result of the democratic process* not about a lack of democratic process
- Inequality is not unique to the United States among democracies
- Inequality is not uniquely tied to any particular political system



## Campaigns and Elections


## Who runs elections in the United States

- State and local governments
- Federal government sets some rules

        - Centered on 14th Amendment
        - Voting Rights Act
        - Help America Vote Act

- Parties also play a role in primary elections, caucuses, and conventions

## Types of electoral rules (voting systems)

- Plurality system

        - First-past-the-post system
        - Winner-take-all system
        - Common in the United States
        - The winner take all aspect accounts for the dominance of two major parties
        - If there are a dozen closely matched candidates, the winner may only get 20% of the vote
        
- Majority system: candidate must win 50% + 1 vote
- Runoff election: if no candidate wins majority, top two candidates face off in a second election
- Ranked choice voting / instant runoff voting

        - voters rank candidates in order of preference
        - Uncommon now but used in the past in some major cities
        - Now used in Maine and Alaska for federal elections

## Presidential General Election

Electoral College

        - Indirect election

        - We elected Electors pledged to those candidates
        - Electors meet in December to cast their votes
        - Congress counts the Electoral College votes in January
        

- Indirect election of the chief executive is not unique to the United States
        
        - The Electoral College is unique to the United States
        - Most democracies are parliamentary systems where the chief executive is chosen by the legislature
        - The Electoral College is a compromise between direct election and election by the legislature
        - Preserves federalism and the power of the states
        - Preserves the Separation of Powers (Congress role is extremely limited)

## Election campaigns

- Campaigns are long and expensive
- Campaigns are run by professional staff
- Campaigns are media-driven
- Expensive campaigns favor incumbents over challengers

        - incumbents: current officeholders
        - challengers: candidates running against incumbents
        
- Incumbents have name recognition and a record to run on
- Incumbents have access to campaign funds from PACs and other sources

## Federal Election Campaign finncing

        - Goes back to 1867
        - Federal Election Campaign Act (1971)
        - Federal Election Commission (1974)
        - Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (2002)
        
- Free speech issues

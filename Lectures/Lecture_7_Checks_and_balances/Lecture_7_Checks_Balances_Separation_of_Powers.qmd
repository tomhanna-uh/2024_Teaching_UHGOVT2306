# Today's Topic: Separation of Powers, Federalism, Checks and Balances

## Review

- Basic philosophy: Classical liberalism  Basic good: empowering individuals
- Basic bad: too much government power / abuse of power /  too much organized violence
- Solution:  Splitting up power
- Flaws in the system: conflicted with classical liberal ideals  
- Flaws: necessary result of compromise and distrust of centralized powers.
